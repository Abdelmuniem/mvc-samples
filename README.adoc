= Samples for MVC 1.0 (JSR-371)

The code in these samples are highly experimental as the work on JSR 371 is ongoing. That means that they may not always build or run on the latest snapshots. 

The latest versions of the spec and reference implementation can be found here:

 - Specification: https://java.net/projects/mvc-spec/pages/Home
 - Reference Implementation: https://ozark.java.net/
